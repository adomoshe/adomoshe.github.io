                        Welcome to Crystal Collector!

                        When pressed, each crystal adds a random number between 1-19 to "Your Total". That crystal will always add the same number until the game is over.
                        To win, the player must figure out how to add "Your Total" such that it equals the "Goal" number. If "Your Total" exceeds the "Goal" number then the player losses.
                        Once the player either wins or losses, then a "Play Again?" button will appear. If pressed, "Goal" and the crystals generate new numbers while a tally of wins and losses is kept.
                        Good luck!
